FilmMate Prototype Development Prompt
Create an interactive web prototype for a film photography assistant application called "Filmate" with the following specifications:


Overview
FilmMate helps novice film photographers determine optimal camera settings based on their equipment and shooting conditions. The app should combine camera specifications, lens characteristics, film properties, and lighting conditions to recommend appropriate aperture and shutter speed settings.


Core Structure
Design the application using object-oriented principles with these primary classes:


Camera: Stores camera body specifications including available shutter speeds
Lens: Contains lens properties and available aperture values
FilmStock: Represents different film types and their characteristics
LightingCondition: Different lighting scenarios with corresponding EV ranges
ExposureCalculator: Contains the logic for calculating optimal settings
ShotLog: Records of photos taken with specific settings
ShotLogManager: Handles the storage and retrieval of shot logs
Main Views
Settings Selection Screen:
Camera selection dropdown (initially only Canon AE-1)
Lens selection dropdown with common Canon FD lenses
Film stock selection with popular options
Lighting condition selector
Generated Settings Screen:
Display recommended aperture, shutter speed and ISO
Show alternative setting combinations
Option to log the shot
Return to settings option
Shot Log Management Screen:
List of previously logged photos
Filtering and sorting capabilities
Detailed view of individual logs
Manual log entry functionality
Core Functionality
The heart of the application should be the exposure calculation system that:


Takes the selected ISO from the film stock
Uses the EV (Exposure Value) from the selected lighting condition
Considers available apertures from the selected lens
Considers available shutter speeds from the selected camera
Calculates all valid exposure combinations
Recommends the optimal combination plus alternatives
The calculation should follow standard photographic principles where:


The Sunny 16 rule serves as baseline (at EV 15, correct exposure is f/16 at 1/ISO)
For each stop of light, either double the exposure time or open aperture by one stop
Formula: 2^EV = (aperture^2 × 100) / (ISO × shutterSpeed)

User Experience
Intuitive interface for beginners
Educational elements that explain why certain settings are recommended
Simple navigation between the three main screens
Responsive design for both mobile and desktop use
Technical Specifications
Store user data in local browser storage
Initial database should include the Canon AE-1, common Canon FD lenses, popular film stocks, and standard lighting conditions as specified in the requirements document
Develop this prototype focusing on the core functionality and clear user experience to help novice film photographers make better exposure decisions.
